INFO:ollama_app:Question: What is this image?
INFO:ollama_app:Answer: The image shows the derivative of a function, f(x), evaluated at x=x1.  Specifically, it represents the formula:  x2 = x1 - (f'(x1))
INFO:ollama_app:Thought: The equation represents the definition of the derivative of a function, f(x), evaluated at a point x1. The derivative, f'(x1), represents the instantaneous rate of change of f(x) at x=x1.
