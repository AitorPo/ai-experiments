INFO:ollama_app:Question: What is this image?
INFO:ollama_app:Answer: The image shows the derivative of a function, f(x), evaluated at x = x1.
INFO:ollama_app:Thought: The formula is for calculating the derivative of a function f(x) at a point x = x1.

INFO:ollama_app:Question: What is this image?
INFO:ollama_app:Answer: The image shows the definition of the derivative of a function, f(x), at a point x1. Specifically, it represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f(x) at the point x1.
INFO:ollama_app:Thought: The equation `x2 = x1 - (f(x1) / f'(x1))` is the slope-point form of the derivative of a function f(x). It's commonly used in calculus to find the derivative of a function at a specific point.
