# Twitter Clone - Hexagonal Architecture

## Domain Rules
- Users can create posts (tweets) with text, images, and links
- Posts have a 280 character limit for text content
- Users can follow/unfollow other users
- Users can like, retweet, and reply to posts
- Posts can be public or private
- Users have profiles with bio, avatar, and statistics
- Real-time notifications for interactions
- Timeline shows posts from followed users chronologically

## Architecture Patterns
- Follow hexagonal architecture with clean separation of concerns
- Use async/await for all I/O operations
- Implement CQRS pattern for read/write operations
- Use domain events for cross-cutting concerns
- Apply repository pattern for data access
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use DTOs for API boundaries
- Apply dependency injection throughout

## Code Quality
- Use type hints everywhere
- Follow Django and Python best practices
- Write comprehensive tests for all layers
- Use proper logging and monitoring
- Implement proper security measures
- Follow REST API design principles
